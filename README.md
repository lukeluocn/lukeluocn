### Hi there ✨✨✨

I am maintaining this README to recommend open-source projects that I find useful and/or interesting.

#### If you are a Go fan...

- [juju/mutex](https://github.com/juju/mutex)

> _`juju/mutex` may help when we want to protect critical resources across process boundaries._

#### If you live with Cloud-Native...

- [octohelm/harbor](https://github.com/octohelm/harbor)

> _`octohelm/harbor` provides up-to-date builds for self-hosting Harbor on ARM64 servers._

#### If you play with bare-metal...

- [solarkennedy/ipmi-kvm-docker](https://github.com/solarkennedy/ipmi-kvm-docker)

> _I constantly have to operate on remote machines with IPMI. It had always been a frustrating job, given the broken network and the old JAVA Runtimes assumed, until I found `solarkennedy/ipmi-kvm-docker` that allows me to spawn a battery-included container with FireFox, JAVA Runtimes, VNC, etc. right near the machines._

#### If you enjoy autonomous robots...

- [campusrover/labnotebook](https://github.com/campusrover/labnotebook)

> _This is a living knowledge base for the Autonomous Robotics course at Brandeis University. I appreciate their efforts towards alleviating repetitive problems by gathering wisdoms from different generations of students._

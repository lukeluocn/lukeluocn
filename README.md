### Hi there ✨✨✨

I am maintaining this README to recommend open-source projects that I find useful and/or interesting.

#### If you live with Cloud-Native...

- [octohelm/harbor](https://github.com/octohelm/harbor)

> _`octohelm/harbor` provides up-to-date builds for self-hosting Harbor on ARM64 servers._

#### If you play with bare-metal...

- [solarkennedy/ipmi-kvm-docker](https://github.com/solarkennedy/ipmi-kvm-docker)

> _I constantly have to operate on remote machines with IPMI. It had always been a frustrating job, given the broken network and the old JAVA Runtimes assumed, until I found `solarkennedy/ipmi-kvm-docker` that allows me to spawn a battery-included container with FireFox, JAVA Runtimes, VNC, etc. right near the machines._
